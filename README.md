## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with Reflow, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CHETHAN562/reflow.git
   cd reflow
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Docker installed on your Linux VPS. You can install it using the following commands:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker.io
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```

3. **Build the Docker Image**:
   Run the following command to build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t reflow .
   ```

4. **Run the CLI Tool**:
   You can now run the Reflow CLI tool. Check the usage section for details.

## Usage üì¶

After installation, you can use Reflow to manage your Next.js deployments. Here‚Äôs a basic command to get you started:

```bash
./reflow deploy <your-nextjs-app>
```

Replace `<your-nextjs-app>` with the path to your Next.js application. This command will initiate the deployment process using the Blue-Green strategy.

### Command Options

- `deploy`: Deploy your Next.js application.
- `status`: Check the status of your current deployment.
- `rollback`: Roll back to the previous version of your application.

## Deployment Strategies üîÑ

### Blue-Green Deployment

Reflow implements the Blue-Green deployment strategy, which allows you to maintain two identical environments (Blue and Green). You can switch traffic between these environments with minimal downtime. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Prepare the Green Environment**: Deploy your new version to the Green environment.
2. **Test the Green Environment**: Ensure everything works as expected.
3. **Switch Traffic**: Once validated, switch traffic from Blue to Green.
4. **Rollback if Necessary**: If issues arise, revert traffic back to Blue.

This strategy significantly reduces the risk associated with deploying new versions.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Reflow allows you to customize your deployment settings through a configuration file. Create a file named `reflow-config.json` in the root of your project. Here‚Äôs an example configuration:

```json
{
  "appName": "My Next.js App",
  "port": 3000,
  "dockerImage": "my-nextjs-app:latest",
  "nginxConfig": {
    "serverName": "myapp.com",
    "root": "/usr/share/nginx/html"
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

- `appName`: Name of your application.
- `port`: Port on which your application will run.
- `dockerImage`: Docker image to use for deployment.
- `nginxConfig`: Nginx configuration settings.
